# Landing-Page

Project Description
This is my second project from The Odin Project. It is a landing page that will be made with HTML and CSS. The layout of the page will be made with Flexbox. 
I made this project into a landing page fo "Vivid Video Editing" because other than programming, video editing is my second hobby. This project was somewhat hard and there were many bugs that hindered my progress. However this is the first time since I picked up frontend development that I had a clear vision on how to accoplish each section with flexbox.
From this project, I became proficient the art of flexbox and learned how to use it somewhat efficiantely to accomplish the layout I desired. Another key takeaway from this project was the importance of organization. My HTML document became harder to read as the project reach fruition. Along with this, I took many breaks from this project and commits saved me lots of time and allowed me to pick up right were I started.
